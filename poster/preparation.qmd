# Introduction
This document contains the data engineering required to reconstruct and improve the visualization by @dottle_climate_2023, shown in @fig-bb, depicting the frequency and estimated costs of Billion-Dollar Disasters (BDDs) in the USA by year, between 1980 and 2024.

The code below requires the following packages:

```{r}
#| label: required-packages
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
source("utils.R") # Custom utility functions and variables
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-bb
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Frequency and Estimated Costs of Billion-Dollar Disasters in the
#| USA from 1980 to 2024, by @dottle_climate_2023."

```

# Dataset
To conduct analysis on BDDs, two datasets published by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) of the United States of America were used [(NCEI, 2024)](#references). An additional dataset derived from the NCEI's [website](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/state-summary/US) via web scraping was also used to provide additional contextual information on individual BDD events.

A summary on the three datasets used is provided below:

1.  `events-US-1980-2024.csv`: This dataset contains information on BDDs in the USA from 1980 to 2024, organised by each individual event. This dataset was last revised by NCEI on 25 May 2024, and available [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/archive/archive-management-system/OAS/bin/prd/jquery/accession/download/209268).
2.  `time-series-US-cost-1980-2024.csv`: This dataset contains information on BDDs in the USA from 1980 to 2024, organised by year and category. This dataset was last revised by NCEI on 25 May 2024, and available [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/time-series).
3.  `additional-events-US-1980-2024.csv`: This dataset was derived from the NCEI's [website](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/state-summary/US), last updated on 8 May 2024, via web scraping and contains additional information on individual BDD events. It will be combined with the `events-US-1980-2024.csv` dataset to provide more context on each BDD event.

## Process Events Data
### Base Events

  )

```

### Additional Events
```{r}

### Combine Events Data

         `Unadjusted Cost`, `Summary`) |>
  arrange(`Year`, `Begin Date`, `End Date`)
bdd_events

# Ensure that there are no missing values or categories
verify_data(bdd_events)

# Export combined dataset into CSV
write_csv(bdd_events, "data/combined-events.csv")
```

## Process Combined Events Data
Get frequency and estimated cost of BDD events by year, which is equivalent to the `bdd_events` and `bdd_frequency` tibbles, but not including categories with values = `0`. This is to enable cross-checking and data verifications to be performed, to ensure that the values in `bdd_events` and `bdd_frequency`, derived from the time series dataset, are accurate and correct.
```{r}
#| label: process-combined-events-data

# Get frequency and costs of BDD events by year
bdd_events_frequency_cost <- bdd_events |>
  group_by(Year, Disaster) |>
  summarise(
    Count = n(),
    `CPI-Adjusted Cost` = sum(`CPI-Adjusted Cost`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Unadjusted Cost` = sum(`Unadjusted Cost`, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  mutate(Category = case_when(
    Disaster %in% names(disaster_mapping) ~ disaster_mapping[Disaster],
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  )) |>
  select(`Year`, `Disaster`, `Category`, `Count`,
         `CPI-Adjusted Cost`, `Unadjusted Cost`)
bdd_events_frequency_cost

# Ensure that there are no missing values or categories
verify_data(bdd_events_frequency_cost)
```

# Conclusion
The data are now ready for visualization. The next step will be to create a plot that will allow us to visualise the frequency and estimated costs of Billion-Dollar Disasters in the USA from 1980 to 2024.
